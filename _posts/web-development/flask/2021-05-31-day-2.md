## Day - 2: Welcome to the world of web

The **world wide web**  abbreviated as www known as web. The world wide web in simple terms is a networking across the computers in the world. Internet, private vpn's, proxy servers facilitates the network connectivity between the computers. Two machines in a network can communicate if they adhere to a common medium of communication. This common medium is **protocol**.

For this discussion we will get into to details of 
1. HTTP
1. REST

HTTP is one of the most popular protocol and has ruled this space for last 2 decades. HTTP has been able to sustain and manage the needs of the modern systems. Computers, smart devices and IoT products use HTTP protocol to 
1. render web pages
1. move resources over the network.

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is not a standard but it is a spec that adheres to networking standards. The other specs like REST are

1. SOAP
1. GraphQL
1. gRpc

To begin with we would develop application following the REST Specification on Flask.

#### Key terms

Two major terms/concept a web developer must be aware of are 

1. ##### Resource: 
In simple terms **target** of a http request is called a resource. Say when you login to Google/Facebook the target authentication system is a resource. While performing a **Goolge Search** the target which searches the web for the key words requested by the user is also a resource.

1. ##### HTTP Verbs: 
The requests sent to a **resource** will be classified into defined set of Http Verbs. The most commonly used Http Verbs are

    |  HTTP |    Operation |  Analogous to Database |
    |---|---|---|
    | GET | Get a specfic resource. | SELECT|
    | POST | Submit an entity to a specific resource. | INSERT |
    | PUT | Updates an entity to a specific resource. | UPDATE |
    | DELETE | Deletes a specified resource. | DELETE |

Enough of theory ELMO.

We are going to rewamp our `app.py` using the http verbs mentioned above. For now we will use a list a in memory database to maintain the resource.

```python
# Import flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Create a flask instance
app = Flask(__name__)

users = []

# GET Request is the default request type when the method is not specified.
@app.route('/')
def getUser():
    return jsonify({'users': users})


#CREATE a new user request with POST request.
@app.route('/add', methods=['POST'])
def addUser():
    user = {}
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user = request.get_json()
        users.append(user)
    return jsonify({'user': user})


#Update user request with PUT request.
@app.route('/update', methods=['PUT'])
def updateUser():
    user = {}
    if request.method == 'PUT':
        user = request.get_json()
        for userInfo in users:
            if userInfo.get("name") == user.get("name"):
               userInfo.update(user)
    return jsonify({'user': user})


#DELETE User
@app.route('/<string:username>', methods=['DELETE'])
def deleteUser(username):
    global users
    if request.method == 'DELETE':
        userInfo = [user for user in users if user.get('username') != username]
        users = userInfo

    return jsonify({"message": f"Deleted the user {username}"})


# Start the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)

```

Please refer github for the [code](https://github.com/pyVarad/flask-blog/tree/main/Day-2). 

We will discuss this code in detail on our next section. 

That's all for today. Happy coding.
