## Test API
Testing your API is important. It is during testing we unearth some of th edge cases that has to be handled and failures from unhappy paths. My favourite tool for API testing during development is **postman**. My recommendation is to create API tests via postman and use these specs to create the API. That takes us to new style of development called **Test Driven Development**.

The test driven development is a systematic way of development. In this process the product owner/ developer creates the API specs as first step. Later during the development these specs become the tasks for the user stories.

This proves very useful to during the sprint demo. The scrum master will be able to match the acceptance criteria of the stories. Also they will be able to revise the backlog and regroom stories in case any acceptance criteria is not met. 

#### API Specs - Day 2

Attaching the link for API spec for the Flask API created in the previous section. **postman** allows us to import the spec and test our API's and test along when we do the development.
